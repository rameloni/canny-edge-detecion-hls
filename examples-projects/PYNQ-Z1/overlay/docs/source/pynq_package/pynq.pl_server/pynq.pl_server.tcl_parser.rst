pynq.pl_server.tcl_parser Module
================================

The pynq.pl_server.tcl_parser module parses the metadata file (tcl file).
The goal is to extract useful information about the bitstream, 
including IP parameters, system clocks, block hierarchy, interruputs, 
and many others. The use of tcl files as a metadata file gets obsolete; 
it is to be retired in the future.
